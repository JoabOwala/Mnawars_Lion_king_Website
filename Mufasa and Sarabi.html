        <h2><u>Sarabi's Family</u></h2>
        <p>She is Mufasa's wife and she has three siblings namely;Dwala,Dwafa,Alfajiri and Janna.Sarabi's name means Mirage and she was the first daughter to Naanda and Jioni.Naanda's name meant Joy.She was followed by Dwala who was the bravest of all cubs.Then after Dwala came Dwafa who was just looking like Sarabi in every part of the body.Then the last born was Alfajiri who was the only boy in the family.He was the only boy in all of the siblings.At the movie Lion-king Part 1,Dwala and Dwafa went hunting in the Pridelands and they noticed Sarabi but Sarabi did not notice them.It was the time when Simba went to play with Nala along with Zazu but only Simba and Nala saw them and at night they even slept behind Pride rock when Sarabi went for a night walk and they went back and told Jioni,Alfajiri,Janna and Naanda that their sister was alive and living a healthy and majestic life.</p>
